== Virtual Terminal ==
This is a virtual terminal.
I want to be able to run programs from this.
I want to be able to simulate VTXXX with this.
I want this to be fast (and customizable).

-- Definition --
A virtual terminal is a program that accepts user input and dispatches commands from the user to the OS (e.g. run a program).
This terminal should support:
    fore/background colors,
    a cursor,
    VT100 (at least) escape sequences (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Escape_sequences),
    command line interfaces (CLI) and text user interfaces (TUI),
    local echo & local editing.

-- Specification --
When processing program output, check for an escape sequence and process it as such (not as text).
    Big ol' switch statement maybe?
    Probably various ifs, kind of like a sieve.
